🧠 RISE Internship – Data Science & Analytics Projects

📌 Overview
This repository contains data analysis projects completed as part of the RISE Internship Program. Each project involves real-world datasets, data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualizations, and insights using Python and relevant libraries.

📁 Projects Included
🧪 Project 1: YouTube Channel Performance Analysis
Objective: Analyze channel-wise and video-level metrics to understand factors influencing views and engagement.

Dataset: YouTube video/channel data (views, likes, comments, etc.)

Techniques: Grouping, correlation, trend analysis

Outcome: Identified top-performing videos and channels based on engagement metrics.

🚖 Project 2: Uber Trip Data Analysis
Objective: Analyze Uber ride data to explore travel patterns, peak times, and operational zones.

Dataset: Uber ride logs (pickup datetime, location, base code)

Techniques: Time-series analysis, frequency plots, heatmaps

Outcome: Revealed hourly & daily peak ride times, popular pickup zones, and monthly demand trends.

📰 Project 3: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means
Objective: Segment customers into behavioral clusters using unsupervised learning.

Dataset: Sales and customer data (Units Sold, Revenue, Unit Price)
